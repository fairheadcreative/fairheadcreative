  <h2 class="single-section__heading">1. Focus On Giving Value</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Most businesses go straight for the sale.</p>
    <p>Know why? <em>Because they think they have no other choice.</em></p>
    <p>They think that if they don’t, their visitors might leave and never come back, and that’s it. We get it: why come back if they’re not buying?</p>
    <p><strong>Consider this: if you’re asking for the sale on first contact, <em>you may be the one driving them away.</em></strong></p>
    <p>Question. when was the last time you bought something from a stranger, as soon as you met them?</p>
    <p>Your visitors are finding you in different places, in different states of mind, with different levels of understanding about their problem. Everyone's different. We need to treat them as different.</p>
    <p>It’s important to, from a place of service, <strong>provide massive value for your subscribers and position yourself as an advisor, rather than a vendor.</strong></p>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Once your focus is on giving value, the next hurdle is cutting through the noise.</p>
    <p>Your visitors arrive skeptical.</p>
    <p><strong>And they stay skeptical when your emails hit their inbox.</strong></p>
    <p>Next, we need to nurture each lead as an individual, and give them individual correspondance.</p>
    <p>We don't ever need to ask if they want what you've got. We only ever need to ask which!</p>
    <p>The magic is this: <strong>they will tell you with their actions.</strong></p>
    <p>Did they open the email? Click the link? Act on what the page offered?</p>
    <p><em>This data is available to you right now.</em> Let's learn what to do with it.</p>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Selling with email can be very involved, and very nuanced.</p>
    <p><em>Many people make it even more complicated than it needs to be.</em></p>
    <p>Great email marketing, to us, involves two things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A heart to serve your audience</li>
      <li>The patience to serve everyone at their own pace</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everything else is secondary.</p>
    <p>Making them pretty, or elaborate, is sometimes effective but always secondary to these two core elements.</p>

        How often you should send email marketing material has been a subject of debate for many years. It’s been a fairly polarizing conversation to boot, with strong advocates for daily emailing on one end and cautious testimonials that email flooding motivates unsubscribers on the other.<br><br>

        Every major email client, from Outlook to Gmail to Apple Mail, is set up by default to send in HTML format, and comes with a bunch of tools and options to format HTML.<br><br>

        In the world of email marketing, opens and clicks are everything, which means good marketers are always testing ways to improve these metrics. We'll tweak subject lines, calls-to-action, images, headers, layout, link positioning, copy, length, tone, content ... the list goes on and on.<br><br>
        Through all of this testing, there's a common trend emerging: Aside from proper list segmentation, a frequently preferred visual style that boosts opens and clicks as is an old school, plain-text-looking email.

        Whatever you do, do email.<br><br>
        Email marketing can be challenging, however. Sometimes, email marketers think that it’s enough just to set up the campaign and send off emails every so often.<br><br>
        There is a lot more to it than that. If you truly want a raving fan base of subscribers who love you and will buy from you, you need to know how to earn their love and affection.
