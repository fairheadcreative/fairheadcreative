  <h2>1. Knowing Your Audience</h2>
  <p>If you’re like most businesses, you’re eager to please <em>everybody</em> that could use your product or service. It seems counter-intuitive to narrow the pool when there's so many others who could possibly be interested.</p>
  <p>But consider this: when was the last time you felt comfortable in a one-size-fits-all shirt?</p>
  <p>Different people buy for different reasons. It’s important to define <em>who</em> you want to connect with, so you can determine <em>how</em> to best connect.</p>

      Identifying the influencer, creating a description of that person, and developing a contact plan are key components in this straightforward strategy.

      You may be surprised to find that you're not necessarily a part of your target demographic. No problem.<br /><br />
      Learning about social media trends can put you on the fast-track to understanding your ideal client. Once you're connected, you can conduct surveys to get even more information.

      A big part of building an effective brand is focusing on lasting relationships.<br /><br />
      Focusing on what others want from you is a good way to step outside of yourself and sincerely connect with your audience's needs.

      While traffic is important, your first priority should be to map out your ideal customer acquisition process.<br /><br />
      Imagine your business model utopia, and then manifest it! Answer these questions with your ideal client in mind:
      <ul>
        <li>Where do clients come from?</li>
        <li>Where are you finding them?</li>
        <li>What page do you want them to land on?</li>
        <li>What happens after they take action on that page?</li>
        <li>What happens after that to get them to buy?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

      What difficulties do your ideal clients face? What outgoing communication proves that you understand their information-consuming preferences?<br /><br />
      In-depth marketing research can help you answer those questions.<br /><br />
      Surveys, comprehensive guides, and white papers reveal everything from general trends in lead generation to social media effectiveness for a given content medium.

  <h2>2. Communicating Empathy</h2>
  <p>You’ve defined your audience. You’ve researched their interests. You’re confident you know exactly who you want to serve.</p>
  <p>Now, it’s time to create value for those people by communicating empathy.</p>
  <p>See, it’s not enough anymore to have a good product. It’s not even enough to have a clear picture of your ideal buyer.</p>
  <p>You have to show them that you understand their difficulties, even better than they understand them themselves.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://fairheadcreative.com/blog/audience-feel-screwed-over-by-your-content/">Question Your Motives</a><br />
      Honesty time: question the sincerety of your message, by making sure you’re honoring your audience's time.<br /><br />
      Now, we all know you want to make sales. But your message won’t land if your website doesn’t truly serve from your heart.
   </li>
    <li>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://content4demand.com/blog/is-your-content-under-the-influencer/">Be the Best Solution</a><br />
      You won’t get traction if you’re not providing quality! You need to communicate your message in a way that really resonates with your audience.<br /><br />
      Investing half-heartedly in superficial content doesn’t work. Provide real solutions. Improve lives by being the best solution for your specific audience.
   </li>

      If your audience believes you understand their problem better than they do, they'll automatically assume you have the solution.<br /><br />
      Show your website visitors that you <em>get them.</em> Don’t just solve the symptoms they see, solve the problems they suffer from.<br /><br />
      Let them know you’ve walked a mile in their shoes. Show them that you’re a fully-sympathetic parter.

  <h2>3. Testing Your Tactics</h2>
  <p>Is your website perfect?</p>
  <p>There’s always room to improve, you know that.</p>
  <p>When you’re confident you’ve identified your audience and connected with them empathetically, it's time to test your tactics.</p>

  <p>Why leave conversions to chance? Eliminate variables and know for sure what works.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.demandgenreport.com/resources/research">Strengthen Connections</a><br />
      Communicate your message with topics you're sure your ideal client finds engaging, and focus on lead-nurturing.<br /><br />
      Connect to traffic most likely to run through the entirety of your conversion funnel. Both you and your audience win.

      Does your website’s offer sound 'sales pitch-y' or does it sound like the perfect solution to your audience’s problem?<br /><br />
      Your clients aren't idiots. If you concern yourself with the bottom line alone, your business won't attract clients worth keeping.

  <h2>4. Using Data to Iterate</h2>
  <p>Having tested your website, it's now time to self-reflect.</p>
  <p>Look critically at your performance. Did your community embrace your message? Your offer?</p>
  <p>Review what you did, and then <a href="/process/">start the cycle</a> with new eyes.</p>

    <li>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://content4demand.com/services/">Are You Self-Sabotaging Your Sales?</a><br />
      Mind the gap! The next logical step is to analyze your content.<br /><br />
      What opportunities did you miss to make connections with potential buyers? Where did potential clients fall off?<br /><br />
      Why didn't they connect to your well-targeted content?<br /><br />
      What part of your conversion funnel needs to be changed immediately? Develop a plan that includes a strategy of prioritizing concerns.

      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.realmagnet.com/blog/2015/09/why-diverse-content-is-vital-for-campaign-success-4/">Keep them Engaged</a><br />
      Diversify your content. Delivering multiple kinds of creative content keeps people engaged.<br /><br />
      Animated gifs, infographics, videos, and other interactive content makes your content interesting in new ways.<br /><br />
      After spending all that time capturing your well-defined audience, it's important to keep them engaged. Don't lose them to static content!<br /><br />
      Assess your analytics and move forward with improving your communications.

      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/generational-marketing.asp">You've Mastered the Craft. Now Expand Your Audience</a><br />
      Consider expanding or honing your audience based on generational-marketing, if your product lends itself to multiple approaches.<br /><br />
      Once you've reached your key audience, your sales could skyrocket with a reassessment of your pitch, if done carefully!<br /><br />
      Personalization and targeted communication will get you your first key group. Use the same tactic to widen your sales funnel.

      What's hot now? Last year your client was obsessed with webinars.<br /><br />
      Today their favorite way to connect could be through podcasts.<br /><br />
      The tides of tech advancement and audience preferences demand you be versatile and dynamic when targeting your audience.
