    <h2>Who do we <strong>look for?</strong></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>People with vision.</strong>
        Where making a difference is more important than the paycheck or fancy office.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>People with values & honor.</strong>
        Those that paint the back of the fence. Who live by truth. Who you can trust.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>People who disrupt & innovate.</strong>
        Leaders, not followers, with a sense of ownership for their part of the company.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>People ready to grow.</strong>
        Who love the amount of personal and professional investment we make in them.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What do we <strong>provide?</strong></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Work with purpose.</strong>
        What’s the point in working on things that don’t make a difference in the world? We’re committed to helping people make a difference.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Work with friends.</strong>
        Teams are more than the sum of their parts when there’s camaraderie and friendship. Our team is designed for relationships.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Work whenever.</strong>
        Like to hit the beach for a few hours on Fridays? We honor our team by giving each other the freedom to choose our own hours.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Work wherever.</strong>
        We’re 100% remote, so we can choose our cities & countries based on things like family, hobbies, and schools for our children.
      </li>
