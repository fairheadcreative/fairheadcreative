  <h2 class="single-section__heading">We price not based on demand, but on what we’d charge friends.</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Most companies in our industry increase their prices with increased demand. This means that good work is often out of reach, leaving you with only mediocre opportunities.</p>
    <p>We could (and really should) charge a lot more than we do. But we’re not just your service provider: we’re your mission partner. <strong>We charge our clients what we’d charge our friends</strong> - an aggressively low price for a game-changing level of service.</p>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>There are a near infinite number of options in the market we serve.</p>
    <p>If all you want is a clean, workable website, we encourage you to contact any of them. If instead you want someone who is much more <strong>mindful of the outcomes you really want</strong>, then you’ve already found the right partner.</p>
    <p>Each member of our hand-picked team is - individually - outstanding. And, because of the unique game that we play, their game has been further elevated: because we do everything congruently <strong>to make a difference for our clients.</strong></p>

  <h2 class="single-section__heading">We believe that your website must help you achieve your goals.</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>It’s common for a practitioner to fall in love with their work. In the world of the web, that often results in artistic expression coming before real effectiveness.</p>
    <p>Your business’ goals should come before aesthetics, or industry best practices, or anything else.</p>
    <p>You see, we’re not in love with our services: <strong>we love our clients.</strong></p>
    <p>We don’t get caught up in ‘pretty’, or ‘trendy’, or ‘expected’. We get caught up in your vision, and in expressing that to your audience in a way that <strong>gets you real, measurable results.</strong></p>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>You shouldn’t feel in the dark about what’s going on with your web presence. Too many companies in our space forget that.</p>
    <p><strong>We take this seriously</strong> - we know it’s not just the work, but the relationship with your web partner that counts.</p>
    <p>If you send us an email, we’ll reply within a working day. If you call us, we’ll pick up the phone. We’ll send you regular updates on how everything is going, to <strong>keep you in the loop at all times</strong>, and to get feedback from you every step of the way.</p>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>It’s natural to be nervous about signing a contract that commits time and money to a company you’ve not worked with before.</p>
    <p><strong>We do something unheard of in this industry:</strong> if you’re unsatisfied with our work, we’ll give you 50% of your money back for that month, and we’ll guarantee to fix whatever it was you were unsatisfied with by the end of the following month.</p>
    <p><strong>You have all the control, we have all the risk.</strong> As your trusted advisor in this space, that’s how we believe it should be.</p>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Our industry is full of “Clients from Hell” jokes, as though clients are widely considered to be the key shortcoming of any business.</p>
    <p><strong>Your web presence represents your mission online.</strong> While we passionately search for ways to present you in the best light possible, we request (and delight) in your input, whatever it is.</p>
    <p><strong>It’s only right when it represents your vision, and gets you results.</strong> Both are critical ingredients to what we call ‘success’.</p>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Our industry is full of hot trends, tools and technologies that come and go. Once they’re gone, good luck getting support for them.</p>
    <p><strong>Your web presence needs to keep on working</strong>, for years to come. Technological changes shouldn’t break your work, or make it redundant.</p>
    <p><strong>When we build for the web, we build to last.</strong> We use technology that’s advanced enough to represent your vision, yet mature enough for us to confidently maintain for years to come.</p>
