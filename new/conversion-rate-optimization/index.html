    <p>Most businesses don't know their audience.</p>
    <p>Know why? <em>Because they don't know how to figure it out.</em></p>
    <p>If you’re like most businesses, you’re eager to please <em>everyone</em> that could use your service. We get it: why turn anyone away, right?</p>
    <p><strong>Because if you sell to everybody, you sell to nobody.</strong></p>
    <p>Consider this: when was the last time you felt comfortable in a one-size-fits-all shirt?</p>
    <p>Different people buy for different reasons. It’s important to define <em>who you want to connect with</em>, so you can determine how to best connect.</p>

        You may be surprised to find that you're not necessarily a part of your target demographic. No problem.<br /><br />
        Learning about social media trends can put you on the fast-track to understanding your ideal client. Once you're connected, you can conduct surveys to get even more information.

        A big part of building an effective brand is focusing on lasting relationships.<br /><br />

        While traffic is important, your first priority should be to map out your ideal customer acquisition process.<br /><br />
        Imagine your business model utopia, and then manifest it! Answer these questions with your ideal client in mind:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>Where do clients come from?</li>
          <li>Where are you finding them?</li>
          <li>What page do you want them to land on?</li>
          <li>What happens after they take action on that page?</li>
          <li>What happens after that to get them to buy?</li>

        What difficulties do your ideal clients face? What outgoing communication proves that you understand their information-consuming preferences?<br /><br />
        In-depth marketing research can help you answer those questions.<br /><br />
        Surveys, comprehensive guides, and white papers reveal everything from general trends in lead generation to social media effectiveness for a given content medium.

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>OK. So let’s say you’ve defined your audience. You’ve researched their interests. You’re confident you know <em>exactly</em> who you want to serve.</p>
    <p>Next, it’s time to <strong>create value for those people</strong> by first communicating with empathy.</p>
    <p>See, <strong>it’s not enough to have a good product anymore.</strong> It’s not even enough to just have a clear picture of your ideal buyer.</p>
    <p>You have to show them that you understand their difficulties, <em>even better than they understand them themselves.</em></p>

        Honesty time: question the sincerety of your message, by making sure you’re honoring your audience's time.<br /><br />
        Now, we all know you want to make sales. But your message won’t land if your website doesn’t truly serve from your heart.

        You won’t get traction if you’re not providing quality! You need to communicate your message in a way that really resonates with your audience.<br /><br />
        Investing half-heartedly in superficial content doesn’t work. Provide real solutions. Improve lives by being the best solution for your specific audience.

        If your audience believes you understand their problem better than they do, they'll automatically assume you have the solution.<br /><br />
        Show your website visitors that you <em>get them.</em> Don’t just solve the symptoms they see, solve the problems they suffer from.<br /><br />
        Let them know you’ve walked a mile in their shoes. Show them that you’re a fully-sympathetic parter.

        Communicate your message with topics you're sure your ideal client finds engaging, and focus on lead-nurturing.<br /><br />

        Does your website’s offer sound 'sales pitch-y' or does it sound like the perfect solution to your audience’s problem?<br /><br />
        Your clients aren't idiots. If you concern yourself with the bottom line alone, your business won't attract clients worth keeping.

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Having tested your website, it's now time to self-reflect.</p>

        Mind the gap! The next logical step is to analyze your content.<br /><br />
        What opportunities did you miss to make connections with potential buyers? Where did potential clients fall off?<br /><br />
        Why didn't they connect to your well-targeted content?<br /><br />
        What part of your conversion funnel needs to be changed immediately? Develop a plan that includes a strategy of prioritizing concerns.

        Diversify your content. Delivering multiple kinds of creative content keeps people engaged.<br /><br />
        Animated gifs, infographics, videos, and other interactive content makes your content interesting in new ways.<br /><br />
        After spending all that time capturing your well-defined audience, it's important to keep them engaged. Don't lose them to static content!<br /><br />
        Assess your analytics and move forward with improving your communications.
