        <strong>Websites are tactical.</strong><br>
        All talk, no big-picture plan.

      <li>
        <strong>Websites pitch people cold.</strong><br>
        When’s that ever a good ROI?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Websites have one shot.</strong><br>
        Visitors either buy or they leave.

        <strong>Buying a website is confusing.</strong><br>

    <p>Think about the last person who came to your website & left. For seemingly no reason. If only you could have at least known who they were, right?</p>
    <p>You've got a great business, offering great value. But nobody's seeing that. You're not convincing them in 5 seconds, and they're gone. It stinks, we know.</p>

        We go to extraordinary lengths for our clients. Because of this, we’re selective about who we work with. We start by determining if you’re a good fit for our Fairhead Creative family of clients.

  <article class="letter">
    <p>Dear change maker,</p>
    <p>If you own a website, or you’re thinking of getting a website made, you’ve got a huge responsibility. The right site will create huge gains, the wrong one will <strong>stunt your growth and chances of success.</strong></p>
    <p>We’ve watched the website industry become a race toward the latest techniques and tactics, all in an attempt to “mind-hack” one's way into skeptic wallets.</p>
    <p>We started building FairSites because there’s a better way. We believe that people trying to make a difference in their market deserve a website worthy of their vision.</p>
    <p>We don’t just make websites, we go through <strong>enormous efforts to create real results and impact.</strong></p>
    <p>We believe the very best work should be available to the people who need it, not just huge companies with huge budgets.</p>
    <p>Our team is 100% committed to making FairSites the highest value, most trustworthy, most results-based option in the website industry.</p>
    <p>We can’t take on everybody: we select our clients based on how much impact we can create with them in their marketplace.</p>
    <p>To make it totally risk-free for you, <a href="/start/">we’d like to show you how a FairSite can benefit your business, without commitment or signup.</a> It’ll be our pleasure.</p>
    <p>To your success,</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>What if I don’t like your work?</dt>
    <dd>We’ll fix it. These things are a process. But, if you want to back out, ask us about our money-back guarantees (not that anyone’s ever needed them!)</dd>

    <dt>I don’t know what we need on our site…</dt>
    <dd>You’re not alone. Thankfully, we have a proven, <a href="/process/">tested process</a> for <em>discovering what your audience wants.</em></dd>

    <dt>Can I try you guys out for free?</dt>
    <dd>Sure! Why don’t you <a href="/start/">let us figure out how you can improve your sales &amp; signups, for free?</a> It’ll be our pleasure!</dd>

    <dt>What will be expected of me?</dt>
    <dd>We’ll ask you some questions when we get started, and we’ll email you with occasional requests for feedback &amp; approval. We’ll take care of the rest.</dd>

    <dt>What makes a good client?</dt>
    <dd>We can’t take on everybody as a client - we select our clients based on how much of an impact we can create for them in their marketplace. Good clients are also committed to their business' success, and are receptive to trying new ways to improve their performance. If that doesn’t sound like you, that’s cool - there'll be someone for you!</dd>

    <!--<dt>How will communication work?</dt>
    <dd>We’ll communicate with you with phone and email. Skype too, if you're outside the US. Our team communicates internally using <a href="http://basecamp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Basecamp 3</a>.</dd>-->
  </dl>
  <dl>

    <dt>Who specifically will I be working with?</dt>
    <dd>You’ll be working directly with Leslie, your new project lead. She’s a real gem: she’ll make sure you’re fully looked after, that budgets are followed and deadlines are met.</dd>

    <dt>How will you define success?</dt>
    <dd>If your website is creating more sales, engagement or impressions, we consider that a success. 'Making it pretty' is not the definition of success - even if it is to most agencies!</dd>

    <dt>I only want certain parts of a FairSite.</dt>
    <dd>We’ll customize yours to suit you. We’re flexible.</dd>

    <!--<dt>I'm looking for something smaller.</dt>
    <dd>We have a <a href="#">smaller, simpler option that transforms underperforming webpages into a lead converting machine, within the week.</a></dd>-->

    <dt>I still have some concerns…</dt>
    <dd>We asked our clients what concerns they felt while considering signing up with us, <a href="/why/">then we listed out how we address them.</a></dd>

    <dt>I don’t know…</dt>
    <dd>If you feel skeptical, we understand how you feel. The web is full of empty promises, and we’ve felt the same way numerous times. <em>Bring your skepticism with you:</em> <a href="/start/">we’ll prove the quality of our work to you.</a> And if you’re unhappy with it, it’s on us until you are.</dd>
