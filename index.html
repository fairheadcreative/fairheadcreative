  <h2>Meet Charlie.</h2>

  <p>Charlie ran an online business, not too different to yours. It worked okay, but he couldn’t help but feel as though it could be doing more.</p>

  <p>As though there was more his website could be doing for him. That there was opportunity left on the table.</p>

  <p>He decided he wanted to achieve 3 outcomes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>For his visitors to have the motivation to buy from him.</strong> 
      He needed to ethically and strategically motivate his prospects from "I dunno…" to "Sign me up!"
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>For his company to get more sales, customers, calls…</strong>
      He wanted to benefit from company growth, thanks to the compounding improvements on his website.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>For his customers to have a deeper emotional connection to his brand.</strong>
      He needed impassioned customers that would spread his message on his behalf.
    </li>
  </ol>

    <h2>Charlie realized he had 4 options…</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <img src="/images/home2/option-1.svg" alt="UX Design Company Florida" title="UX Design Company Florida" width="150" />
        <strong>Try to do it himself.</strong> 
        He'd need to train and perform at 5+ expert jobs in addition to running his own online business. Ouch.
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="/images/home2/option-2.svg" alt="UX Design Company Tampa" title="UX Design Company Tampa" width="150" />
        <strong>Buy a template / theme</strong> 
        By definition, it's not designed for his audience. How can his business look unique if he spends money on looking the same?
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="/images/home2/option-3.svg" alt="Creative Web Design Company Florida" title="Creative Web Design Company Florida" width="150" />
        <strong>Hire a traditional agency</strong> 
        High price tags made his eyes water. These can be expensive, and most agencies don’t (or can’t) prove the ROI of their work.
      </li>

      <li>
        <img src="/images/home2/option-4.svg" alt="UX Design Company Tampa" title="UX Design Company Tampa" width="150" />
        <strong>Partner with us</strong> 
        He had the opportunity to work with a talented team that let him choose his own price &amp; where ROI is proven. As a result…

        <strong>A website that works hard.</strong>
        Charlie’s website has a sales process that turns visitorsfrom cold leads to passionate customers. It really works.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Access to new tools.</strong>
        He got access to lots of new tools he’d never heard of before, to help him engage with his customers inexciting new ways.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Pricing he got to choose.</strong>
        Charlie knows his business finances best, right? Therefore he’s the best person to choose the final price. So he did!
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>3 money-back guarantees</strong>
