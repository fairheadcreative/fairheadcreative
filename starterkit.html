  <h2 class="single-section__heading">Starter Kits: All you need to get started online.</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Normally, people buy 'themes' to start new websites, cheap.</p>
    <p>But themes are designed to be slick, not to get you customers.</p>
    <p>Themes can't email your visitors, get you appointments, automate your sales, or keep people coming back for more.</p>
    <p>That’s why we created Starter Kits: so you can use the proper tools, on a budget, <em>and your site can grow into the big-leagues</em>.</p>
    <p>Normally, our Starter Kits cost $495.</p>
    <p><em>But we’re going to actua<em class="ring">lly give you</em> a Starter Kit today.</em></p>
    <p>We know you’re going to love it, <strong>but first, let’s talk about what your Starter Kit includes:</strong></p>
  </div>

<section class="single-section">
  <img class="single-section__figure why-figure-2" src="/images/starterkit-1.jpg" alt="" width="430" />
  <h2 class="single-section__heading">We start with your website’s content.</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>What good is a “pretty” website if you’re saying all the wrong things?</p>
    <p>What if you’re just talking about yourself, rather than showing your audience that you understand their problem even better than they do?</p>
    <p>Your new Starter Kit will include a content upgrade, to <strong>make sure you’re saying the right things to the right people.</strong></p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="single-section">
  <img class="single-section__figure" src="/images/starterkit-2.jpg" alt="" width="430" />
  <h2 class="single-section__heading">Then we build your site, specifically for you.</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>If you bought a theme, you’ll know other people did too.</p>
    <p>And <strong>their sites will look almost exactly like yours.</strong></p>
    <p>It won’t be designed for your specific content, your specific message, or your specific offer.</p>
    <p>Your new Starter Kit solves these problems: <strong>it’s built for you.</strong></p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="single-section">
  <img class="single-section__figure" src="/images/starterkit-3.jpg" alt="" width="430" />
  <h2 class="single-section__heading">We’ll load in your new content, your images, your assets.</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>Your Starter Kit isn’t designed around you, or your business.</p>
    <p>It’s focused on your visitors!</p>
    <p>Your Starter Kit will visually communicate what they need, want and feel ready for, at the time they visit your page. <strong>No visitor leaves empty-handed.</strong></p>
    <p>And no visitor leaves without giving you their email address, so that you can follow up with them.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="single-section">
  <img class="single-section__figure" src="/images/starterkit-4.jpg" alt="" width="430" />
  <h2 class="single-section__heading">Every one of your visitors gets automatic followup.</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
    <p>After your visitors take you up on your initial offer (which they will), they’ll be followed up with.</p>
    <p>Not once, and not with a sales pitch.</p>
    <p>It’ll start a relationship with the visitor, so that you can lead them to a close in their timing.</p>
    <p>Your Starter Kit will do <strong>all this for you, automatically.</strong></p>
  </div>

<section class="single-section group-top">
  <h2 class="single-section__heading">Get a website that does all this today:</h2>

  <div class="single-section__content">
