    <ol class="numbered-list">
      <li class="numbered-list__item">
        <strong class="numered-list__item--title">A breakdown of your site’s messaging</strong>
        Most websites are about the company they’re built for, rather than about the visitors they exist to serve.<br><br>
        The purpose of marketing is to educate someone in a way no-one else has, to realize something troubling them, or motivating them that their issue can be solved by you. <em>We’ll show you how we’d make your messaging non-threatening, so you can initiate more relationships.</em>
      </li>

      <li class="numbered-list__item">
        <strong class="numered-list__item--title">A breakdown of your homepage’s opening section</strong>
        99% of websites we see commit one or many online marketing sins in their homepage opening section.<br><br>
        For example, you may dive straight into what your service is, rather than into the problems you exist to solve for your target audience (and then proving it).<br><br>
        <em>We’ll show you what these sins are, and how you can fix them.</em>
      </li>

      <li class="numbered-list__item">
        <strong class="numered-list__item--title">A breakdown of how you’re presenting your core offer</strong>
        Your visitors need to connect with you without risk, or they’re unlikely to connect with you.<br><br>For example, before you ask for an opt-in, you need to explain exactly what’s inside (like we’re doing right now!)<br><br>
        Marketing is ethical one-on-one salesmanship, multiplied - <em>we’ll show you how we would optimize your site’s offer so that it’s impossible to refuse.</em>
      </li>


      <li class="numbered-list__item">
        <strong class="numered-list__item--title">A breakdown of what’s slowing your site down (with fixes)</strong>
        Most websites are pretty slow these days, with all the fancy tricks and bloated 'themes' being used.<br><br>
        99% of the time, websites we create reports for could run 2x faster with just a few simple adjustments.<br><br>
        <em>We’ll show you what those adjustments are, so you can get immediate speed gains.</em>
      </li>

      <li class="numbered-list__item">
        <strong class="numered-list__item--title">A breakdown of your site’s current design</strong>
        Is it helping you make income? Is it sending the right impression to make people connect with you?<br><br>
        Can the design even have that much of an impact on such things?<br><br>
        <em>Absolutely. We’ll show you what’s missing, and what needs changing so that the design is actually helping you get results.</em>
