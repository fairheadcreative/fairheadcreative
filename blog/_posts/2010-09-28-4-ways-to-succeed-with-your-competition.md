We see it every day. Turn on the TV and you'll see people talking about themselves on every channel. Look out the window and you'll see branding on the side of every other vehicle that passes by. How do you stand out?

There's a mad rush for self-promotion. Everybody needs to be looking at you, all of the time. Heads up: Not everyone is looking at you, all of the time. So where are we going wrong? Are we all too obsessed with ourselves to listen to one another? Do we even care about each other anymore? Here are some ways to save us from a selfish culture that could devalue our very own efforts, and succeed with our competition.

## Make your Competitors your Comrades

We're all human and we're all in the same boat as each other, why not get along? Befriend those who are in the same industry as you. If they're in the same industry as you they are likely have very similar interests and goals to you: you're passing up some potentially great friendships out there! Speak fondly of one another; in the Bible Ephesians 4:29 it says “Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.” Pretty appropriate, don't you think?

## Celebrate Other People's Achievements
In Proverbs 15:4 it says “The tongue that brings healing is a tree of life, but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit.” If a competitor comrade wins an award, a common response is to become jealous, tear apart their efforts in your mind and wallow in resentment for that person. After all, you deserved that award, right? No: celebrate other people's achievements, and they may even celebrate with you back when it's your turn to be #1.

## Help Each Other Out
We've all been there. It's getting late into the afternoon and you're still struggling with something you started in the morning. If only you could work out that problem so you can get on with other things! If only you knew how to overcome that hurdle. Seem familiar? We've all been there. When a comrade struggles, help. When you struggle, ask for help. Everybody wins.

## Divide and Conquer
Work is always better when you're doing something you enjoy doing. My favorite daily tasks are likely different to yours; why not pass on the things we don't enjoy to those who like it? That way, we all spend more time doing the things we love, and less time doing the things we don't. If you're enjoying your work, you're happier: Happy is contagious. Spread the happy!

Help other businesses and they will help you, seek God first and he will provide you with whatever you need – such as good business perhaps. </p><p>If you don’t live by bible verses the sentiment remains true, doesn’t it? I know most of us aren’t in business to make friends- but we all could use more contacts and all relationships have the potential to turn into something more. Plus we all need help sometimes.</p><p>Thanks for the good word and the good advice.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div id="comment-71" class="row comment"><div class="large-12 columns"><div class="panel"><div class="row"><div class="large-2 columns text-right push-10"><a href="#" class="avatar"><img alt="" src="http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/8e69a768cd68f5b2119be997896e2b2e?s=100&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D100&amp;r=G" class="avatar avatar-100 photo" height="100" width="100"></a></div><div class="large-10 columns pull-2"><p><cite><b><a href="http://fairheadcreative.com" rel="external nofollow" class="url">Adam Fairhead</a></b> &nbsp; <span class="smaller">October 5, 2010 at 4:12 pm</span></cite></p><p>You’re welcome!
