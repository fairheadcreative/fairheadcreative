If you're a website owner, here's a little something for you. FC Webicons is a set of resolution-independent social icons for use on your website. They use feature-detected SVG graphics (with PNG fallbacks) to display the icons over their appropriate negatively indented anchor titles.

All this means that your icons will look gorgeous on retina display devices as well as standard devices. These should come in really handy when you need 2x visuals with more detail than icon fonts can provide.  Enjoy the icons!
