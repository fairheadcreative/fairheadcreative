        <p>As a service targeting small businesses, it was crucial that the service appeared friendly and easy to use,</p>

    <h2>SMTP2GO</h2>
    <div>
      <p class="lead">Needing a complete visual overhaul, SMTP2GO chose Fairhead Creative.</p>
      <p>Charlie and his team at SMTP2GO focus on making a difference in the world of email delivery. After operating for a while with a dated brand and website, he approached in need of an overhaul.</p>
      <p>The exact functionality that SMTP2GO provides can be a little confusing for people to understand. Fairhead Creative were tasked not only with making their new image beautiful, but with visualizing their work: not just selling their product, but communicating why it’s important.</p>

    <div>
      <p>The application was also redesigned, taking the features and functionality they have and making it easier to use.</p>
      <p>All this work was designed to respond to their customer’s choice of hardware. Be it an iPhone or a Cinema Display, their site and app adapt to make the most of screen estate.</p>
      <p>Finally, the whole setup was created using our extensible front-end framework.</p>
